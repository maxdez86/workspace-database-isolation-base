Contributions are accepted at the owner's discretion and remain subject to the
terms in [LICENSE](LICENSE). Merging a contribution does not grant a license to
the project.

## Before making a change

- Open or reference an issue that explains the goal, affected paths,
  constraints, and expected verification.
- Keep changes focused. Avoid unrelated refactors or formatting.
- Do not add secrets, credentials, personal data, or customer data. The seed
  file contains fictional workspaces only.
- Record the license of any new dependency.

## Working on the code

- `packages/core` holds the rules and queries; `apps/api` is only the HTTP
  layer and `apps/worker` is only scheduling. Put shared behaviour in `core`.
- Every business row belongs to a workspace. Queries that read or write
  workspace data take the workspace id explicitly; never rely on a caller
  having filtered earlier.
- Write to the audit log inside the same transaction as the change it records.
- Public API shapes are contracts: add fields, do not rename or remove them
  without a deprecation note in the PR.

## Database changes

- Add a new `packages/db/migrations/NNNN_name.sql`. Applied migrations are
  immutable; the runner refuses to start when one changed.
- Grant the `ticketry_app` role exactly what the runtime needs, and nothing
  else. It must never own objects.
- Keep migrations restartable: use `IF NOT EXISTS` where a rerun after a
  partial failure is plausible, and keep each file to one concern.

## Validation

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
```

Integration tests need PostgreSQL (see the README). Add a test in the package
you changed: a repository test in `packages/core` needs an HTTP or job test
alongside it when the behaviour is reachable from the outside.

## Review

Submit changes through a pull request into `dev` with a short description of
the behaviour, the validation performed, and any known limitations.
